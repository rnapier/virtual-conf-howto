## Giving a Virtual Talk

With all these virtual conferences going on, a lot of folks are giving their first virtual talks. This captures a few
lessons I've learned so far in how to make these work the best they can.

## My setup

My setup may not be the same as your, so not everything here may work for you. Mostly I'm going to document how I do it,
and you can take from it what works.

Quick summary: 

I have a dedicated office with a stand-up desk and a large monitor, along with my MacBookPro which I use as a second monitor.
Both are on arms to hold them up to eye level. I use Keynote for my talks, and will focus on how to set that up. I mostly
work with Zoom, so I'll discuss that too.

## Setting up your desktop

I really like having two screens so that I can share one, full screen. You should share the smallest of your screens (probably
the laptop). However large it is will be large enough for sharing, and smaller screens use less bandwidth. Sharing a full
screen makes it easy to know what you're sharing and what you're not.

Clear everything off your second screen. It should just have a background and the menu bar. If you're a packrat and keep
tons of things all over your desktop, make a folder and stick everything in that folder for while you're presenting. That
way the desktop is not distracting when you close Keynote or switch to Xcode, etc.

## Setting up Keynote

Keynote works well in a 2-monitor configuration. You can present on the small screen (that you're sharing) and view your notes
on the large screen. Cmd-Opt-P will start presenting. If the windows are on the wrong screen, press X to switch them.

Your camera should be on the screen with your notes. If you use speaker notes, I suggest reorganizing the presenter window
to puth the notes at the top. Here's my layout.
